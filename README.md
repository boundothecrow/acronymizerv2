# Acronymizer
Input your own series of letters and/or words, and have it spit out an acronym, with colorful choice of vocabulary!


## What's this all about, eh?
Well, it was already stated!


## Wow, that's amazing!
...yup, it sure is...


## What's an "Acrobet?"  Some kind of acrobatic gambler?
Acrobet is a play on words of sorts of combining "Acronym" and "Alphabet."  All of this is placed within a JSON file, so that each letter can be catagorized, and contain various amounts of "exciting" words.

This also seperates "regular" words, and explicit, not so work-friendly words.

###### (Soon there might be catagories to list different types of words, on top of the explicit set of words.  Like verbs, gadgets, people's names. etc)


## I see...what kind of words is expected to be added into your "Acrobet?"
Just words that you can mix together to make some sense.  However, I aim to add any words that might make a possible combination of words together to make it funny, even if it's a little nonsensical.  Using "NPM" as an example, some results might come out something like "Nostril Picking Managers," or "Nottingham Pickle Monsters."


## Can I contribute?
Of course!  It's GitHub, afterall.
